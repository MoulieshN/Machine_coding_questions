# Low Level Design of ElevatorSystem
An elevator system is designed to efficiently transport people between floors in a building. The system needs to handle multiple requests, optimize elevator movement, and ensure safety. The system should be able to accommodate different priorities, handle emergency situations, and provide a smooth user experience.


## Rules of the System:

* The building has multiple floors and can have multiple elevators.
* Elevators can be called from any floor and can travel to any floor.
* Each elevator has a maximum capacity and weight limit.

* The system schedules elevator movement based on requests and optimizes for efficiency.

‍

Operation:

* Users can request an elevator from any floor by pressing up/down buttons.

* Inside the elevator, users can select destination floors. (There is one more type, where users can choose destination floors outside only, but we are not covering those here !!)

* The system prioritizes and schedules these requests efficiently.

* Elevators have indicators showing current floor and direction.

 ‍

Safety Features:

* Emergency stop functionality must be available.

* Overload detection prevents elevator movement if capacity is exceeded.

* Door sensors prevent doors from closing if obstructed.
